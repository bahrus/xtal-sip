# \<xtal-sip\>

<a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/element/bahrus/xtal-sip/demo/index.html">Demo</a>

Dynamically "water" a custom element tag with the necessary dependency to sprout the tag from an inert seedling to a thing of beauty.  Dependency free.

NB:  This component suffers currently in terms of IDE and build support, especially compared to the Polymer supported [lazy-imports](https://github.com/Polymer/lazy-imports).

Importing the files needed for web components seems likely to become a lot more complicated.  Some references will come from bower_components, some from node_modules.  Some will be references to html files, others js files.  And the references are likely to be in a state of flux, as the [whims of elite developers](https://codeburst.io/the-javascript-modules-limbo-585eedbb182e) change.  Components will first migrate to node_modules (how will we explain to our grandkids that web components are node modules?).   As support for HTML Imports wanes, many  *.html files will be converted to *.js files, then to *.mjs files, then back to *.mhtml files, once the W3C Ents show some HTML love.  That will shortly be followed by converting them to *.wasm, followed by the Universal binary format that includes HTML, JS, CSS, WASM: *.xap.

This component, \<xtal-sip\>, is intended to "centralize the pain."  Keep the mappings between custom element tags and where to load the references for them all in one place.

The annoying thing about HTMLImports (and ES6 Modules for that matter) is that creating references for each referenced web component inside an HTML or JS file feels like tedius busy work -- for HTML files, one must go towards the top of the page (outside any templates) to add the reference, and typically the reference is just a trite formulaic derivative of the tag name itself.  E.g. \<paper-input\> => \<link rel="import" href="../paper-input/paper-input.html"\>, \<paper-checkbox\> => \<link rel="import" href="../paper-checkbox/paper-checkbox.html"\>.   And all these references add to the footprint of the application.

On top of that, leveraging a CDN when deploying [some of the] files to production could also be simplified by managing dependencies centrally.  Or maybe some components should only be activated in debug mode on the developer's workstation, but not deployed to production.

Another scenario is when raw HTML content containing web components is rendered inside a code-centric framework, like (P)react.  Not having a good solution to this scenario may partly explain why we are "throwing in the towel," pushing web components that might be 99% static markup, 1% JavaScript, to be packaged /coded entirely in JavaScript. Sad!  

What if the markup is generated by a server-side framework like asp.mvc or Java EE MVC, which may use web components to supplement the server-side generated HTML?  Although we are not supposed to use the PWA Hacker News site to ["compare the performance of one PWA to another"](https://hnpwa.com/), one can't help noticing that the fastest performing implementation is the one that uses [no JavaScript, other than the service worker](https://github.com/davideast/hnpwa-firebase). Clearly, this is an architecture we can't dismiss.  But creating the web component references in a different location from the custom element tags when using a server-side solution can be quite awkward in these scenarios.   

The bottom line is that the need for centralizing management of references is likely to increase significantly. 

That's where \<xtal-sip\> fits in.

Whether using HTML Imports, or simple JavaScript references, or ES6 Modules, there's a pretty good principle that we can assume regarding web components:  *Each web component will depend on only one top-level reference*.  (One small exception to that rule, at least in spirit, appears to be with components that depend on icon libraries, like paper-icon-button).  Of course, that reference file itself will likely specify multiple other references recursively, following standardized module conventions, which is all fine and good.  \<xtal-sip\> is meant for content-heavy, non reusable web compositions, as opposed to highly reusable web components. 

xtal-sip assumes that web sites will want to take advantage of the recent web standard that allows  [content to be preloaded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content).  

```html
<link rel="preload" href="..."> 
```

For performance reasons, it is useful to use these to preload all these references ahead of time.  Might as well build on this support to provide the mappings we need, and not repeat ourselves.

So what does xtal-sip add to the \<link rel="preload"\> functionality?

## Auto triggering based on tag name

```html
<link 
    rel="preload" 
    as="document" 
    href="//myCDN.com/@bower_components/paper-checkbox/paper-checkbox.html" 
    data-tag="paper-checkbox"
>
```

NB:  Currently, Chrome does not preload assets when as="document."  This seems like a bug to me, but what do I [know](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=593267)?  Attempting to work around this unexpected behavior by setting as="script" causes duplicate requests, which is probably worse. 

When \<xtal-sip\> encounters a \<paper-checkbox\> tag (how it encounters it will be discussed later), it will perform a hash lookup for link preload tags with attribute 'data-tag="paper-checkbox"', and it will formally load the reference.  

## Compact dependency preloading

It was mentioned above that listing all the elements with the same prefix can be boring and add to the footprint.

The markup below allows for more compact dependency.

```html
<link 
    rel-ish="preload"  
    as="document" 
    href="//myCDN.com/@bower_components/paper-{1}/paper-{1}.html" 
    data-tags="paper-checkbox,paper-input,paper-button"
>
```

This is a "fake" preload tag, that is used as the foundation for dynamically generating multiple valid preload tags.

For each tag name found in the data-tags attribute, that name is split using the dash "-" delimiter.  {1} refers to the split array, index = 1.

xtal-sip will "autoexpand" this, and dynamically create multiple genuine preload tags in the header where each file is listed explictly.

Here's an even more aggressive example, that uses {0} and {1}:

```html
<link 
    rel-ish="preload" 
    as="document" 
    href="//myIoTServerRunningFromMyMicrowaveOven.com/npm/{0}-{1}/{0}-{1}.html" 
    data-tags="paper-checkbox,paper-input,paper-button,iron-input">
>
```


## Preemptive loading

By default, xtal-sip doesn't add the live import tag to the header until it actually spots such a tag in the live markup.  This allows us to stay on the conservative side and only load what's really needed.

However, if preemptive loading is desired, add the data-preemptive attribute:

```html
<link 
    rel="preload" 
    as="document" 
    href="../bower_components/paper-checkbox/paper-checkbox.html" 
    data-tag="paper-checkbox" 
    data-preemptive
>
```

## Async loading

If the preload tag has attribute data-async, then live references will use async capabilities (async import, async script reference).

## Script references

```html
<link 
    rel="preload" 
    as="script" 
    type="module" 
    href="node_modules/platinimum-{1}/platinum-{1}.js" 
    platinum-sw
>
```
## Bundling

Some CDN's, [like jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/features) allow you to combine multiple assets together with one http request.

> https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/combine/gh/jquery/jquery@3.2/dist/jquery.min.js,gh/twbs/bootstrap@3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js

[Support](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/modules/concat/) [is](https://code.google.com/archive/p/modconcat/) also available on some web servers.

One can also utilize build processes that generate bundled resources that contain definitions for multiple custom elegant tag names.

While xtal-sip doesn't do anything to create these bundled resources, or build the url's needed for concatenated resource requests, it does check if it has already requested a request before for other tag names, and if so, doesn't reload that url.

## ES5 / HTTP/1 alternative references

One of the more complex pieces to consider is the issue of browsers that don't support ES6 classes, a cornerstone of web components.  And also, browsers / servers (or proxies) that don't support HTTP/2.  These should all be temporary problems, but unfortunately "temporary" could be several years.

I'm sure anyone reading this has thought about the "Fiddler on the roof" conundrum of how best to package and serve all users optimally.  On the one hand, the simplest thing to do is assume only the browsers that support ES6 will also suppport HTTP/2 and just build a giant bundle for ES5, and treat those users separately.  On the other hand even HTTP/1 users would benefit from some code splitting / progressive enhancement caching.  On the third hand...

The goal of xtal-sip is to be flexible enough that developers can find a way to apply the best strategy for their use case.

We basically need some support for an if condition on the link tag, or even better, a switch statement.

Since think the easiest approach to this is to have the developer define a (gasp) (namespaced protected) global viariable.  In the example below, I use xtal_sip_browser_env. One of the (if not the) top most script tag of the header can be used to set the global variable.  Something like:

```html
<script>
    customElements.whenDefined('xtal-sip').then(xs =>{
        
    })
    const xtal_sip_browser_env = []; 
    if(/*test for IE*/){
        xtal_sip_browser_env.push('ES6Challenged');
    }
    if(/*test for Dev*/){
        xtal_sip_browser_env.push('Dev');
    }
    if(/*test for HTTP/2 somehow*/){
        xtal_sip_browser_env.push('H2');
    }
</script>

<link 
    rel="preload"

```


TODO:  Use attribute href_es5="..." to provide an alternative url to use for ES6-challenged browsers.

When \<xtal-sip/> is instantiated, it searches its neighbors (starting from the parent) for any such nodes that need "watering".  If it finds some matching nodes, then for each one, it checks if the custom element tag name has already been registered.  If not, it will dynamically load the starting reference for the custom element.

## Performance Optimizing

The guesswork involved in searching a DOM tree for matching tag names comes with a (minor) cost.  This can be eliminated by adding explicit tags to load, as the data-tags attribute:

```html
<xtal-sip data-tags="paper-input,iron-ajax"></xtal-sip>
```
